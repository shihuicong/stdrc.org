# STDRC — Shanghai Tennis Dynamics Research Center

STDRC (Shanghai Tennis Dynamics Research Center) is an independent research initiative focused on the physics and biomechanics of modern tennis strokes.  
The center aims to build a scientific framework for understanding forehand acceleration, whip-like phase interactions, angular momentum pathways, and high-speed kinematic signatures.

## 🔬 Research Focus

STDRC explores fundamental questions in tennis dynamics, with emphasis on:

- **Forehand dynamics and acceleration**
- **Phase-Reversal Whip (PRW) forehand**
- **Angular momentum transfer and torque generation**
- **Double-circle trajectory interactions**
- **Bimanual stroke mechanics**
- **High-speed (240fps) video kinematics**

All research is grounded in physics-based analysis, non-linear motion patterns, and experimental observations.

## 📁 Repository Content

This repository hosts the source code and static assets for the STDRC website, including:

- `index.html` — main website structure  
- `/notes/` — short theory notes (to be expanded)  
- `/articles/` — extended essays and research commentary  
- `/prw/` — Phase-Reversal Whip forehand documentation  
- `/lab/` — high-speed kinematic analysis notes  

The site is deployed via **GitHub Pages** and designed in a clean, minimalistic Apple-inspired style.
